## [Arrays](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/)

- [x] [Subarray sum equals k](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/)  
  - **Problem Statement:** Given an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k.

- [x] [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)
  - **Problem Statement:** Search a target value K in an array A sorted in ascending order which is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

- [ ] [Set matrix to zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/)
  - **Problem Statement:** Given a m x n matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0. Do it in-place.
  
- [ ] [Find the maximum element in an array which is first increasing and then decreasing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-maximum-element-in-an-array-which-is-first-increasing-and-then-decreasing/)
  - **Problem Statement:** Given an array of integers which is initially increasing and then decreasing, find the maximum value in the array.

- [x] [Subarray sum closest to 0](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-sub-array-sum-closest-0/)
  - **Problem Statement:** Given an array of both positive and negative numbers, the task is to find out the subarray whose sum is closest to 0.

## [Trees](https://leetcode.com/tag/tree/)

- [x] [Validate BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/)
  - **Problem Statement:** Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

- [ ] [Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-traversal/https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-traversal/)
  - **Problem Statement:** Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

- [x] [Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/)
  - **Problem Statement:** Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree. The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants.

## [Heap](https://leetcode.com/tag/heap/)

- [x] [Kth Largest Element in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/)
  - **Problem Statement:** Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

- [ ] [Merge K sorted lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/)
  - **Problem Statement:** Merge k sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list.
