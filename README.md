- [ ] [Find the maximum element in an array which is first increasing and then decreasing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-maximum-element-in-an-array-which-is-first-increasing-and-then-decreasing/)
  - **Problem Statement:** Given an array of integers which is initially increasing and then decreasing, find the maximum value in the array.

- [x] [Subarray sum equals k](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/)  
  - **Problem Statement:** Given an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k.

- [x] [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)
  - **Problem Statement:** Search a target value K in an array A sorted in ascending order which is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

- [x] [Subarray sum closest to 0](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-sub-array-sum-closest-0/)
  - **Problem Statement:** Given an array of both positive and negative numbers, the task is to find out the subarray whose sum is closest to 0.

## [Queues](https://leetcode.com/tag/queue/)

## [Trees](https://leetcode.com/tag/tree/)

- [ ] [Cousins in a binary tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/cousins-in-binary-tree/)
  - **Problem Statement:** Given the root of a binary tree with unique values, and the values x and y of two different nodes in the tree. Return true if and only if the nodes corresponding to the values x and y are cousins.
  - [GeeksForGeeks Solution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-cousins-of-a-given-node-in-binary-tree/)

- [ ] [Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-traversal/https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-traversal/)
  - **Problem Statement:** Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

- [x] [Validate BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/)
  - **Problem Statement:** Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

- [x] [Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/)
  - **Problem Statement:** Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree. The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants.

- [x] [Root to leaf path sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/)
  - **Problem Statement:** Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.
